This assignment is analysis of resturants' hygiene in the United Kingdom for the food magazine, Eat Safe, Love. There are two parts: Setup and analysis.

## Part 1
This setups up the database from a given json file called "establishments.json". A new resturant called "Penang Flavours" was added even though it has no ratings/scores yet.

## Part 2
This is the simple analysis of the resturants such as ones with good scores and ones will a score of 0. As well as which local authority has the most establishments with the lowest hygiene score and more.
